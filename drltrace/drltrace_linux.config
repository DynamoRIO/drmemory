# drltrace default config file for library call arguments printing in Linux.

# The syntax of this config file is simple. To add a new function, it's enough to specify
# function's return type, function name and each argument of the function separated by
# a pipe | symbol. A token __out is used to mark output arguments and __inout is used to
# mark input+output arguments.
# Example: int strcmp (char *, char *) -> int|strcmp|char *|char *
# i#1948: The syntax now does not cover many other more complex function prototypes
# e.g. atexit(). We need to improve that.
#
# NOTE: the syntax is not space sensitive.

int|strcmp|char *|char *
int|wcscmp|wchar *|wchar *
int|printf|char *
int|puts|char *
