\page page_drltrace Library Tracing Tool

drltrace is a DynamoRIO client tool that records calls to shared libraries.
It reports all invocations of exported functions in all shared libraries
loaded into the target process.

The runtime options for this tool include:
 - \b -only_from_app:
    Only reports library calls from the application itself, as opposed to
    all calls even from other libraries or within the same library.
 - \b -logdir dir:
    Sets the log directory, which by default is "-".
    If set to "-", the tool prints to stderr.
 - \b -ignore_underscore:
    Ignores library routine names starting with "_".

Here is an example:

\code
bin32/drrun -t drltrace -only_from_app -- hello.exe
\endcode

Here is a portion of the output from the above command:

\code
~~~~ ntdll.dll!RtlDecodePointer
~~~~ ntdll.dll!RtlEnterCriticalSection
~~~~ ntdll.dll!RtlEnterCriticalSection
~~~~ ntdll.dll!RtlLeaveCriticalSection
~~~~ ntdll.dll!RtlEnterCriticalSection
~~~~ ntdll.dll!RtlEnterCriticalSection
~~~~ KERNEL32.dll!WriteFile
