/* Conventions:
 * + We use \\verbatim b/c it nicely highlights command lines, but
 *   because aliases aren't expanded in \\verbatim (or \\code), we have
 *   a pre-processing pass that replaces them.  We used to use
 *   \\par<tt>...</tt> to get aliases expanded but it doesn't look
 *   as nice.  Note that \\if is NOT supported by the script so
 *   use it outside the \\verbatim.

\page page_light Light Mode

Dr. Memory provides a "light" mode that detects fewer errors in order to
gain performance.  It does not detect uninitialized reads nor leaks.  It
does detect unaddressable accesses, invalid heap arguments, GDI usage
errors, and warnings.
Use the runtime option \p -light to use light mode.

To add leak checking to light mode, add the option \p -count_leaks after
the \p -light option.  This will identify all error types except
uninitialized reads.
