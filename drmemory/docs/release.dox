\section sec_changes Changes Since Prior Releases

The current version is \TOOL_VERSION.
The changes between \TOOL_VERSION and version 2.1.0 include:
 - Nothing yet.

The changes between version 2.1.0 and version 1.11.0 include:
 - Added preliminary 64-bit full mode (i.e., with uninitialized read
   checking) support.
 - Added preliminary support for the Windows Subsystem for Linux
   environment with the regular Dr. Memory Linux package.
 - Added automated generation of system call information on Windows,
   enabling running on new releases of Windows 10.
 - Added support for Windows 10 1703.
 - Added support for Windows 10 1709.
 - Added support for Windows 10 1803.

The changes between version 1.11.0 and version 1.10.1 include:
 - Added support for Windows 10 1607.
 - Added support for loading system call numbers from a file, to make
   it easier to update for future major Windows 10 updates.
 - Added an option -ignore_kernel to attempt to continue on even when
   running on a kernel with unknown system call numbers.
 - Added support for Mac OSX El Capitan.
 - Better international string support.

The changes between version 1.10.1 and version 1.10.0 include:
 - Fixed problems with configuration directories on Android.
 - Fixed several bugs, including Windows false positives, ARM
   instrumentation issues, and VS2015 crashes.

The changes between version 1.10.0 and version 1.9.0 include:
 - Added preliminary 64-bit Dr. Memory support for Windows and Linux (but
   not MacOS yet).  This does not yet include uninitialized read checking,
   so we still recommend compiling your application as 32-bit.
 - Added preliminary Linux/ARM and Android/ARM 32-bit Dr. Memory support.
   This does not yet include uninitialized read checking.
 - Added support for Windows 10 1511.
 - Fixed incremental error output to the console for graphical
   applications, which was missing in prior versions when using certain
   consoles such as cmd.
 - Removed the -fuzz_mutator option and replaced it with separate options
   for each component of the mutator.
 - Added custom mutator support to Dr. Fuzz.
 - Changed the mutator option passing scheme for Dr. Fuzz to take in
   an argv-style array of parameters, to better support custom mutators.
 - Added checking that the program counter points to valid memory,
   controlled by the on-by-default -check_pc option.
 - Added a new option -malloc_callstacks for recording malloc callstacks
   to include in alloc/free error reports when leaks are disabled.
   The option is off by default due to the additional overhead that
   it incurs.
 - Added code coverage measurement via a new option -coverage.
 - By default, without the \p -show_reachable option, reachable leak
   callstacks are no longer compared to suppressions, in order to reduce
   overhead.

The changes between version 1.9.0 and version 1.8.0 include:
 - Added support for Mac OSX Yosemite.
 - Added Dr. Fuzz, a fuzz testing framework that facilitates repeated
   execution of any program function while mutating the arguments.
 - Added a fuzz testing mode to Dr. Memory. Use new options -fuzz_target
   and -fuzz_mutator to fuzz test any C or C++ target function having a
   buffer argument and a corresponding buffer size argument.
 - Switched the Windows installer from an NSIS-based executable to
   a WIX-based .msi file.  The new installer automatically adds
   Dr. Memory to the PATH for the current user.
 - Added an unaddressable warning report on a write to read-only memory.
 - Added support for the VALGRIND_DO_LEAK_CHECK annotation.

The changes between version 1.8.0 and version 1.7.0 include:
 - Dropped official support for Windows 2000.
 - Enabled -delay_frees_stack by default.
 - The Windows installer now automatically adds Dr. Memory as an External
   Tool for every installation of Visual Studio on the machine.
 - Changed details of the callstack maximum frame options.
   Added two new options: -malloc_max_frames, used for leak reports (and
   mismatch aux info), and -free_max_frames, used for -delay_frees_stack.
   Changed the default -callstack_max_frames to 20.  -malloc_max_frames
   defaults to the original 12, and -free_max_frames is at 6.
 - Added a new option -check_uninit_blacklist to reduce overhead on modules
   where no uninitialized read error reporting is desired.
   Dr. Memory automatically adds to this list when it sees a whole-module
   suppression.
 - Disabled checks for mixing C library heap routines with Windows API heap
   routines (-check_heap_mismatch) for modules that contain static libc.
 - Changed the drsymcache_lookup() interface.
 - Added extra information to unaddressable error titles to make
   several common types of such errors easier to identify:
   "UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS of freed memory",
   "UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS beyond heap bounds", and
   "UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS beyond top of stack".
 - Renamed option -stderr to -use_stderr.

The changes between version 1.7.0 and version 1.6.1 include:
 - Added a Beta version of Dr. Memory for Mac.  Be aware that this
   is a work in progress, but is far enough along to use on small
   applications.
 - Changed Windows PDB symbols to collapse template parameters to "<>"
   to shrink and simplify callstacks and suppressions.  The old behavior
   can be requested by passing 0x1000 to the -callstack_style option.
 - Changed Linux and MinGW symbols to omit the "()" in C++ symbol names.
 - Added a new Dr. Memory Framework Extension, Dr. SymCache or drsymcache,
   which provides persistent caching of symbol lookup data to reduce
   startup time overhead on large applications.
 - Clarified the final parameter to umbra_get_shadow_memory_type() and
   umbra_shadow_memory_is_shared() to be umbra_shadow_memory_type_t
   rather than uint.
 - Clarified the 2nd parameter to umbra_create_shadow_memory() to be
   umbra_shadow_memory_flags_t rather than uint.
 - Clarified the umbra_shadow_memory_info_t shadow_type field to be
   umbra_shadow_memory_type_t rather than uint.
 - Clarified the umbra_map_options_t flags field to be
   umbra_map_flags_t rather than uint.
 - Added static library versions of drsyscall and umbra.
 - On Windows, handle leak detection (-check_handle_leaks) is now on by default
   in full mode.  However, it is still experimental and conservative,
   placing leaks it's not sure about in potential_errors.txt.
 - Added preliminary shadowing of xmm registers for better Visual Studio
   2013 support.
 - Added preliminary shadowing of mmx registers.
 - Augmented the Dr. Syscall API for MacOS support by adding
   drsys_cur_syscall_result(), drsys_arg_t.value64, and
   drsys_pre_syscall_arg64().
 - The pause in cmd on a frontend error is now bypassable by -batch.
 - Added an option -exit_code_if_errors to return a non-zero exit code
   when errors are detected.
 - Replaced the perl front-end \p drmemory.pl on Linux with an executable.
 - Various bug fixes.

The changes between version 1.6.1 and version 1.6.0 include:
 - Added Windows 8.1 support
 - Added -handle_leaks_only feature for low-overhead handle leak checking
 - Added the -crash_at_unaddressable and -crash_at_error options
 - Added the -no_callstack_use_fp and -callstack_conservative options
 - Various bug fixes

The changes between version 1.6.0 and version 1.5.1 include:
 - Added a separate category of error report, "potential errors", stored in
   potential_errors.txt.  These are errors that are suspected of being
   false positives or limited to system libraries.  It is possible that
   they are in fact true application errors, however.  This separation of
   errors can be disabled with the option -lib_blacklist_frames 0, and
   tuned via the options -lib_blacklist and -lib_blacklist_frames.
 - Added options -lib_whitelist and -lib_whitelist_frames to support
   only displaying errors whose top N frames reference a whitelisted
   module.  Any error that does not match the whitelist is separated
   as a "potential error" (see the prior blacklist entry).
 - Removed -srcfilter option and replaced with new options -src_whitelist
   and -src_whitelist_frames to support only displaying errors whose top N
   frames reference a whitelisted source file.  Any error that does not
   match the whitelist is separated as a "potential error" (see the earlier
   blacklist entry).
 - Added full support for applications linked with the debug Visual Studio
   C library.
 - Added checks for mixing of C library heap routines with Windows API heap
   routines on the same allocation, under a new on-by-default new option
   -check_heap_mismatch.
 - Switched to replacing the malloc implementation with Dr. Memory's own
   allocator, rather than wrapping the system allocator, for improved
   performance and stability and improved interoperability with
   the Visual Studio debug C library.
 - Improved still-reachable allocation reporting, adding suppression
   support, de-duplication, and hiding of system allocations.
 - Added option -check_prefetch to make it easier to turn off the warnings
   on prefetching unaddressable memory.
 - The GDI error on using a DC by more than one thread is now off by
   default.  It can be enabled with the -check_gdi_multithread option.
 - Added drsys_syscall_gateway() to the Dr. Syscall library.
 - Extended -soft_kills to handle the most common job termination sequences.
 - Further reduced false positives in Windows system libraries by
   continuing to make progress on Windows system call handling.
 - Added a source file package to the release process.
 - Improved Windows 8 support.
 - Improved Visual Studio 2012 support.
 - Added non-ASCII symbol support.
 - Added the total execution time to the logfile.
 - Added default suppressions for real bugs in the Visual Studio C
   and C++ libraries detected by Dr. Memory.
 - Various bug fixes.

The changes between version 1.5.1 and version 1.5.0 include:
 - Re-organized and improved the documentation.
 - Added Visual Studio External Tool support (-visual_studio option)
 - Added experimental support for Windows 8.  However, false positives
   may occur on graphical or networked applications on Windows 8.
   Future releases will add full support.
 - Added Dr. Syscall library and Dr. Memory Framework for building other
   tools from Dr. Memory's feature base.  Future releases will add other
   libraries and add further tool-building support.
 - Added \p drstrace, an initial version of a system call tracer.
   Future releases will expand its capabilities.
 - Added heuristics to distinguish substrings that look like pointers and
   thus reduce false negatives in leak reporting.  See
   the -strings_vs_pointers option.
 - Added a new, experimental lightweight mode: \p -unaddr_only.
 - Added non-ASCII application support.
 - Added option \p -show_duplicates to list details on duplicate errors.
 - Eliminated reliance on the WDK/DDK when building from sources.
 - Fixed PATH limit issue with the NSIS installer.
 - Reduced false positives from bitfields.
 - Fixed problems with debug C libraries on Windows.
 - Fixed some problems in callstack walking.
 - Various bug fixes.

The changes between version 1.5.0 and 1.4.6 include:
 - Compatibility change: GDI usage errors are no longer of type WARNING
   but have their own type GDI USAGE ERROR.  This affects any existing
   suppressions.
 - Added online symbols for Linux, which enables -results_to_stderr.  The
   -aggregate and -skip_results post-processing features are temporarily
   disabled until a future release adds them for both Windows and Linux.

\section sec_limits Limitations

Dr. Memory is still under development.  It has some missing features and undoubtedly
some bugs.  The missing features include:

 - Uninitialized read checking is not yet supported for ARM platforms.
 - Windows system call parameters are not all known, which can
   result in false positives and false negatives, especially on graphical
   applications on more recent versions of Windows.
   Often, these false positives are solely in system library code.
   Dr. Memory attempts to separate such errors into potential_errors.txt.
 - Definedness is tracked at the byte level, not at the bit level,
   which when bitfields are in use can lead to false positives.
 - Mac OSX supports only 32-bit applications and does not yet have
   a full isolation barrier between Dr. Memory and the application,
   which can cause failures on large applications.
 - Race corner cases:
   - Pathological races between mallocs and frees can result in Dr. Memory's
     shadow memory structures becoming mis-aligned with subsequent false
     positives.  However, such a scenario will always be preceded by
     an invalid free error.
   - General races between memory accesses and Dr. Memory's shadow memory
     can occur but errors will only occur with the presence of erroneous
     race conditions in the application.
   - This release can produce false positives if multiple threads write
     to adjacent bytes simultaneously.  Future releases will provide
     options to trade off performance, memory usage, and accuracy.

\subsection sec_interop Interoperability

Dr. Memory may have conflicts with security software or with other software
that injects into the same process as Dr. Memory.  There are known
interoperability problems with some anti-virus applications, including
Avast 8.0.
