\page page_coverage Code Coverage

Dr. Memory provides optional code coverage information to aid in fuzz
testing (\ref page_fuzzer) or in general testing.

\section sec_enable Enabling Coverage Information

Simply specify the \p -coverage runtime option to request code coverage
information.  The raw coverage data will be stored in a file with a "drcov"
prefix in the regular Dr. Memory log directory.  The file will be pointed
at by a line at the end of the summary, if the application has a console
for text output.  This line looks like this:

\verbatim
~~Dr.M~~ Code coverage raw data: /home/joe/drmemory/logs/DrMemory-myapp.13112.000/drcov.myapp.13112.0000.proc.log
\endverbatim

\section sec_postproc Post Processing

The "drcov" file is raw data in \p drcov format that must be post-processed
to make it human readable.  DynamoRIO's \p drcov2lcov utility converts it
into \p lcov format.  The Dr. Memory release package includes a copy of
this utility.  Simply use its \p -input parameter to point at the \p
drcov log file:

\verbatim
dynamorio/tools/bin32/drcov2lcov -input logs/DrMemory-myapp.13112.000/drcov.myapp.13112.0000.proc.log
\endverbatim

The resulting \p coverage.info file (in the current directory by default)
is in the standard \p lcov format and can be processed by the <a
href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php">lcov tool</a> to
produce nice html result pages.

For a full description of the drcov2lcov usage see the \p drcov
documemtation at https://dynamorio.org/page_drcov.html.
