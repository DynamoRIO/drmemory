# We can rely on symbols here as without them we wouldn't see the operator stubs.
# For /MD*, the i#960 suppression already covers it.

# Rather than trying to match all of these:
# A) Precise:

# B) Hash destructor is inlined into another class:

# C) Seen on x64 (did not analyze: Hash inlined again?)
