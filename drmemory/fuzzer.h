 * The fuzzer currently only supports one target at a time. This function may be called
 * multiple times, but on each call the previous target will be removed. Accordingly, this
 * function is not threadsafe and should not be called concurrently. The fuzz target may
 * be explicitly removed by calling fuzzer_unfuzz_target().
 *
 * The fuzzer only supports the first instance of the target module to be loaded. If
 * multiple instances of the module are loaded simultaneously, only the target occurring
 * in the first instance of the module will be fuzzed. It is not necessary for the target
 * module to be loaded at the time this function is called; it will be fuzzed when loaded.
 *
 * Concurrent execution of the target function is supported.
