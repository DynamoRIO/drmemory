What is Dr. Memory?

Dr. Memory is a memory monitoring tool capable of identifying
memory-related programming errors such as accesses of uninitialized memory,
accesses to unaddressable memory (including outside of allocated heap units
and heap underflow and overflow), accesses to freed memory, double frees,
memory leaks, and (on Windows) handle leaks, GDI API usage errors, and
accesses to un-reserved thread local storage slots.

Dr. Memory is based on the DynamoRIO binary translation engine.  Dr. Memory
has full support for Windows (XP and higher) and Linux, with preliminary
Mac OSX, Linux/ARM, and Android/ARM support (32-bit only for those three)
available as a Beta release.

Dr. Memory also includes a system call tracing tool for Windows and a
symbol query utility.

===========================================================================
How do I use Dr. Memory?

Build your application with debug information and then run it under
Dr. Memory.  Errors found are printed to the screen, and a summary is shown
at the end of the run.

--------------------------------------------------
Quick start for Linux:

1) g++ -m32 -g -fno-inline -fno-omit-frame-pointer *.cpp -o myapp
2) bin/drmemory -- ./myapp args_to_myapp

--------------------------------------------------
Quick start for Windows:

If you used the installer, it added Dr. Memory to the current user's PATH,
and a fresh shell should find the "drmemory" command:

1) cl /Zi /MT /EHsc /Oy- /Ob0 /Femyapp.exe *.cpp
2) drmemory -- myapp.exe args_to_my_app

--------------------------------------------------
Quick start for Mac:

1) c++ -m32 -g -fno-inline -fno-omit-frame-pointer *.cpp -o myapp
2) bin/drmemory -- ./myapp args_to_myapp
