What is Dr. Memory?

Dr. Memory is a memory monitoring tool capable of identifying
memory-related programming errors such as accesses of uninitialized memory,
accesses to unaddressable memory (including outside of allocated heap units
and heap underflow and overflow), accesses to freed memory, double frees,
memory leaks, and (on Windows) handle leaks, GDI API usage errors, and
accesses to un-reserved thread local storage slots.

Dr. Memory is based on the DynamoRIO binary translation engine.  Dr. Memory
currently targets 32-bit Windows (XP and higher) and Linux, with early Mac
OSX support available as a Beta release.  64-bit is coming soon.

Dr. Memory also includes a system call tracing tool for Windows and a
symbol query utility.  Those tools are available for both 32-bit and 64-bit.

===========================================================================
How do I use Dr. Memory?

Build your application with debug information and then run it under
Dr. Memory.  Errors found are printed to the screen, and a summary is shown
at the end of the run.

Quick start for Linux:

1) g++ -m32 -g -fno-inline -fno-omit-frame-pointer *.cpp -o myapp
2) bin/drmemory -- ./myapp args_to_myapp

--------------------------------------------------
Quick start for Windows:

1) cl /Zi /MT /EHsc /Oy- /Ob0 /Femyapp.exe *.cpp
